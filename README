This code was written to accompany a presentation at OS Bridge '09 in 
Portland Oregon.  Although it all runs it is not intended for use in any 
serious capacity (you know the warning about not using some software if
you are operating a Nuclear Power Station or controlling Critical Life 
Support Systems?  Well, this is like that but you shouldn't you it to run
an electric can opener).

This code was written for people to learn from.

What you learn is up to you.
